<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Golden puffed pastries are filled with a feta cheese mixture. 
    These can be made ahead, and popped into the oven after your guests arrive.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped green onions</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, blend feta cheese, green onions, and egg. 
        Cut pastry into 12 (3 inch) squares. Place a mounded tablespoon 
        of feta mixture in the center of each square. Moisten edges with 
        water, and fold pastry over filling to form a triangle. Press edges 
        together firmly with a fork to seal. Lightly brush pastries 
        with the egg yolk mixture.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. 
        Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
